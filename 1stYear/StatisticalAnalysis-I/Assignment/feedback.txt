Thoughtful analysis of sampling, data characteristics, choice of distribution and sample size estimate. Well done!

Consider including a statement of conclusion re hypothesis test "we do not have evidence to conclude the mean is different from the median" or vice verse.

Consider mentioning the fact that your sample size estimation is based only on an estimate of SD. Note that CV for t approaches that for Z as sample size increases, so for larger end samples approximating with Z CV is likely appropriate.
